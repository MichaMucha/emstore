    # You can just specify the packages manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().

    # List run-time dependencies here.  These will be installed by pip when
    # your project is installed. For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's
    # requirements files see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    # install_requires=['nameko'],

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). You can install these using the following syntax,
    # for example:
    # $ pip install -e .[dev,test]
    # extras_require={
    #     'dev': ['check-manifest'],
    #     'test': ['coverage'],
    # },

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.  If using Python 2.6 or less, then these
    # have to be included in MANIFEST.in as well.
    # package_data={
    #     'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
    # },

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files # noqa
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'
    # data_files=[('my_data', ['data/data_file.txt'])],

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # pip to create the appropriate form of executable for the target platform.
    # entry_points={
    #     'console_scripts': [
    #         'sample=sample:main',
    #     ],
    # },
)
